# OpenBoomX

Protocol implementation in Go.

## Issues

Still a WIP. Expect a lot of bugs. 

Only works on Linux (and possibly Mac OS) right now.

Windows support soonâ„¢.

## Building

CLI implementation resides in [cli/](cli/), GUI is in [gui/](gui/).

Both can be built by running `go build` in their respective folders.
